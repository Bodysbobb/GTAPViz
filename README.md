# GTAPViz: Automating GTAP Data Processing and Visualization with HARplus

**This package is currently under development.** 
GTAPViz is designed to streamline the **processing and visualization of GTAP model results** using **HARplus**. It enables users to efficiently extract, transform, and visualize data from `.sl4` and `.har` files, reducing the need for manual data handling in GTAP model simulations.
