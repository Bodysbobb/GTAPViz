# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

This vignette demonstrates how to generate structured, publication-ready figures using GTAPVizâ€™s built-in visualization tools.  

The visualization framework is based on the **`SL4Plot`** and **`HARPlot`** sheets, which define the variables and figure titles used for plotting. Users can specify these directly within an external mapping file or generate them dynamically in the R environment.

## Plot Types  

This vignette introduces four different plot commands that can generate more than 10 different plots:

1. [`comparison_plot`](#sec:comparisonplot): Compares a single variable across all experiments for a **selected dimension** (e.g., region, sector). For example, `qgdp`, `ppriv`, and `EV` can be compared across **selected regions** (`REG`).

2. [`detail_plot`](#sec:detailplot): Provides a comprehensive visualization of a variable across **all regions or all sectors** within each experiment. For example, `qgdp` can be plotted across **all regions**, or `qo` across **all sectors** within each country.

3. [`macro_plot`](#sec:macroplot): Presents global macroeconomic indicators without dimensions, where each experiment is represented by **a single aggregated value**. Examples include `pgdpwld`, `qgdpwld`, and `vgdpwld`.

4. [`stack_plot`](#sec:stackplot): Displays the composition of a variable by **stacking its components** within each experiment, facilitating decomposition analysis. Examples include `EV decomposition` from GTAP results.


## Report Tables  

This vignette also demonstrates commands for generating a `report_table` for each plot type. Each plot type has a corresponding `report_table` that pivots and organizes the plotting data in a format suitable for academic papers and allows export to a `.xlsx` file. Users can also choose to generate a standalone `report_table` without creating the associated plot.


For an overview of data processing functionalities, refer to the separate vignette:  
[\href{https://github.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz}{GTAPViz - Data Processing}](https://github.com/Bodysbobb/HARplus).


# Project Directory {#sec:project-setting}

To use this R code, all solution files, including `.sl4` and `.har`, must be saved from RUNGTAP or CMD and placed in the same folder.

Adjust the `<project.folder>` directory to your desired path. If you maintain the same folder structure as in this code, you may not need to modify the input (`<input.folder>`), output (`<output.folder>`), or mapping (`<map.folder>`) directories.

By default, this R code assumes that `<project.folder>` contains the following three main folders:

-   **in** â€“ Stores all input files (i.e., `.sl4` and `.har`). See the [Solution files](#sec:input-files) for details.
-   **out** â€“ Stores all exported output files.
-   **map** â€“ Stores the mapping `.xlsx` file (**critical for processing**).

# Mapping Files {#sec:mapping-files}

The **`<OutputMapping.xlsx>`** specifies the variables to extract from the solution files `<SL4File sheet>` and the HAR file `<HARFile sheet>`. All required variables must be listed in the `"Variable"` column.

For `"Description"` and `"Unit"`, you may:

- Leave the columns blank and put `"No"` in `<info.mode>` [setting](#sec:setting) to exclude these columns.  
  \footnote{If you leave them blank and put `"Yes"` instead of `"No"`, the result will return an empty column in your output.}

- Manually define **all variables** and put `"Yes"` in `<info.mode>` [setting](#sec:setting).

- Leave the columns blank and put `"GTAPv7"` in `<info.mode>` [setting](#sec:setting) to get the default definition and unit based on GTAPv7.  
  \footnote{The GTAP default can only define variables based on the GTAPv7 default set. If you add additional variables to the model, you must manually define the `"Description"` and `"Unit"` in the sheet if needed.}

- Define only some variables, leave others blank, and put `"Mix"` in `<info.mode>` [setting](#sec:setting) to get the definition based on your input for defined variables and the GTAP default for the others.

**Note:** The `"Unit"` column is required for all figure commands; without it, the command will not proceed. The `"Description"` column is optional and can be used as the plot titleâ€”keeping it concise is recommended!

<div style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #282C34; color: #ABB2BF; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; width: fit-content;">
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">

      <th style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Unit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">qgdp</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">Real GDP Index (%)</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">percent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">EV</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">Welfare Equivalents</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">million USD</td>
    </tr>

      <td style="border: 1px solid #ABB2BF; padding: 8px;">percent</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

: Example of SL4File and HARFile sheet

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The mapping file (`<OutputMapping.xlsx>`) can also be manually created in R as a dataframe, provided that it follows the exact structure, including column names. The dataframe must contain at least the `"Variable"` column, while `"Description"` and `"Unit"` columns are optional depending on the selected `<info.mode>`.  

For example, the following R code creates an equivalent mapping dataframe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapping_df <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("qgdp", "EV", "ppriv"),
  Description = c("Real GDP Index", "Welfare Equivalents", "Cost of endowment"),
  Unit = c("Percent", "million USD", "percent"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

# Input Files {#sec:input-files}

The `<case.name>` variable in [setting](#sec:setting) contains experiment names from which results will be extracted and merged into a single output for further analysis, such as graph creation. Multiple experiments can be included, but increasing their number will extend processing time.

## Input Files Format

All input files must be stored in `<input.folder>` (default: `"in"` inside `<project.folder>`). File names must follow `<case.name>` to ensure consistency between input each `.sl4` file must have a corresponding `-WEL.HAR` file

-   `EXP1.sl4`, `EXP1-WEL.har`
-   `EXP2.sl4`, `EXP2-WEL.har`

<div style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #282C34; color: #ABB2BF; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; width: fit-content;">

# Sample Data
Sample data used in this vignette is obtained from the GTAPv7 model and utilizes publicly available data from the GTAP 9 database. For more details, refer to the [GTAP Database Archive](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/archives.asp).

# Loading Package
Before proceeding, ensure that `GTAPViz` and `HARplus` are installed and loaded:
```{r package}
library(GTAPViz)
```

# Input Setup {#sec:setting}

This chunk defines the **experiment names**, **handling of description and unit columns**, and **output formats** for processing GTAP model results.

- **Experiment Names (`experiment`)**:  
  Specifies the names of experiments to process, matching the prefixes of `.sl4` and `.har` files.  
  Example:  
  - `EXP1.sl4` and `EXP1-WEL.har` â†’ Processed as `EXP1`.  
  - `EXP2.sl4` and `EXP2-WEL.har` â†’ Processed as `EXP2`.  

- **Description and Unit Handling (`info.mode`)**:  
  Determines how the `"Description"` and `"Unit"` columns are included in the output:  
  - `"Yes"` â†’ Use manually defined descriptions and units from the mapping file.  
  - `"No"` â†’ Exclude the `"Description"` and `"Unit"` columns.  
  - `"GTAPv7"` â†’ Use default definitions and units based on **GTAP Model Version 7**.  
  - `"Mix"` â†’ Use manually defined values where available, and GTAP defaults for the rest.  
  
```{r Input Setup}
# Define experiment name / output name 
case.name <- c("US_All", "US_All_RetalTar", "US_All_ReduceTar50", "US_All_RegReduceTar50",
                    "US_All10", "US_All10_RetalTar", "US_All10_ReduceTar50", "US_All10_RegReduceTar50")

# Adding Description / Unit (Yes/No/GTAPv7/Mix)
info.mode <- "Mix"
```

# Preparing Input Data

All figures and tables will be sorted according to the order of your input in `<case.name>`, `<selected_regions>`, and `<selected_sector>`.  
For example:  
- If `selected_regions <- c("USA", "CHN")`, the plot for **USA** will appear before **CHN**.  
- If `case.name <- c(EXP2, EXP1)`, the figure panel for **EXP2** will appear before **EXP1** (i.e., from left to right).  

## Automation Based on GTAPv7 Results {#sec:automategtap}

To automate the process of generating figures from GTAP results for GTAP users, I have developed a streamlined data extraction method using the `HARplus` package.  

This automation may not work well for non-GTAP models, so you may need to manually extract and manipulate the data before using the figure code provided in this vignette. Refer to [manual data preparation](#sec:manualdata) for more details.

This command performs the following tasks automatically:

1. **Filtering selected regions** based on the (`REG`) column, as defined in the `<selected_regions>` variable below. Set to `NULL` to extract all regions.
2. **Filtering selected sectors** based on the (`ACTS`/`COMM`) column, as defined in the `<selected_sector>` variable below. Set to `NULL` to extract all sectors.
3. **Adding unit columns** to the dataset.

**Tip:** This automation uses the `"HARplus::get_data_by_dims"` command. However, other formats, such as `"HARplus::get_data_by_var"`, `"HARplus::group_data_by_var"`, or your own data format, can also work with the figure code. Keep in mind that these alternatives may require additional data preparation to ensure compatibility with the figure command.

```{r Preparing Data for Plot}
# Region to be plotted
selected_regions <- c("USA", "CHN", "CAN", "ASEAN", "ROW")

# Sector to be plotted (NULL to select all)
selected_sector <- NULL

# Extract data with region and experiment filters
plot.dta <- plot_gtap_data(
  sl4file = sl4plot,
  harfile = harplot, 
  experiment  = case.name,
  mapping_info = info.mode, 
  region_select  = selected_regions,
  sector_select = selected_sector,
  project_dir = project.folder,
  subtotal = FALSE
)
```

## Manual Data Preparation {#sec:manualdata}

For other models or additional variables that users may want to include in the default model, data can still be prepared in the same format using the following steps:

1. Use `"HARplus::load_sl4x"` or `"HARplus::load_harx"`, followed by `"HARplus::get_data_by_dims"`, to obtain the data in the exact same format.
2. Filter each dataframe using standard R `data.frame` operations, such as:
3. Add the `"Unit"` and `"Description"` columns (the `"Unit"` column is required for processing) using the `"add_mapping_info"` command from this package.

```{r Manual Data Filtering, eval = FALSE}
# Extract Data
sl4data1 <- HARplus::load_sl4x(system.file("extdata", "EXP1.sl4", package = "HARplus"))
sl4data2 <- HARplus::load_sl4x(system.file("extdata", "EXP2.sl4", package = "HARplus"))
sl4data <- HARplus::get_data_by_dims(NULL, sl4data1, sl4data2, merge_data = TRUE)

# Filter Data using Dataframe and lapply
manual.data <- lapply(sl4data, function(x) {
  if (is.data.frame(x)) {
    x[x$REG %in% selected_regions & x$COMM %in% selected_sector & x$ACTS %in% selected_sector
      & x$Experiment %in% selected_exp , ]
  } else {
    x  
  }
})

# Adding Unit and Description Column
manual.data <- add_mapping_info(manual.data, external_map = "/your/mapping.xlsx",
                                description_info = TRUE,
                                unit_info = TRUE)
```

## Customizing Units and Labels (Optional) {#sec:customunit}
The following two optional processes are recommended for better figure illustration. While they are not mandatory, they are highly recommended.  

**Note:** These processes are not automatically applied in the automation step and must be performed manually.

1. **Converting the default unit column** based on your input. For more details, see `"?convert_units"`.  
   - **Note:** You must define the `"adjustment"` method using `/`, `*`, `+`, or `-`.  
   - **Example:** To convert values from million USD to billion USD, set `adjustment = c("/1000")`.

2. **Renaming column names** for figure generation (e.g., renaming `REG` to `Region`) using `<HARplus::rename_dims>`.

```{r Optional Convert Unit and Rename Columns}
# Convert Value if Needed
sl4.plot.data <- convert_units(
  sl4.plot.data,
  change_unit_from = c("million USD"),
  change_unit_to = c("billion USD"),
  adjustment = c("/1000")
)

har.plot.data <- convert_units(
  har.plot.data,
  change_unit_from = c("million USD"),
  change_unit_to = c("billion USD"),
  adjustment = c("/1000")
)

# Convert the column name if needed
rename_col <- data.frame(
  old = c("REG", "COMM", "ACTS"),
  new = c("Region", "Commodity", "Activity")
  )

sl4.plot.data <- HARplus::rename_dims(sl4.plot.data, rename_col)
har.plot.data <- HARplus::rename_dims(har.plot.data, rename_col)

```


# Before Starting the Plot  

:::{.alert}
### **Important: Read Before Plotting**  

Before proceeding, I **strongly recommend** reviewing the help documentation for each plot command using `?`, e.g., `?comparison_plot`.  

Each plot function provides **multiple customization options** and **various export methods**. Understanding these features will allow you to fully utilize their capabilities.  

### **Key Features to Explore**  
Adjusting the following options can **significantly alter figure outputs**, allowing for flexibility in visualization:  

- **`compare_by_experiment`** â€“ Plots **Experiment** on the x-axis and `"x_axis_from"` values as panels.  
- **`separate_figure`** â€“ Creates **individual figures** for each panel value instead of combining them.  
- **`invert_panel`** â€“ Switches the layout by using `"split_by"` for panels and **Experiment for separation**.  
- **`color_tone`** â€“ Controls the **base color** of the plot, ensuring aesthetic consistency.  

By experimenting with these options, you can **generate a wide range of figure formats**, covering almost all visualization needs. The **`color_tone`** parameter further enhances figure aesthetics, making them as visually appealing as desired.  

### **Example:**  
`comparison_plot` allows you to:  
- Swap the axes  
- Export multiple figures, separating them by experiment (i.e., one figure per experiment)  
- Compare data directly within a single figure  

Exploring these options will ensure you make the most of **GTAPVizâ€™s visualization tools**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Rule of Thumb:** You can modify and rename almost all columns in the dataframe **as long as you adjust the corresponding code accordingly**.  

**However, you must NOT rename the column names** `"Experiment"`, `"Value"`, and `"Variable"`. All values inside these columns **can be modified freely**, but their column names must remain unchanged.

# Comparison Plot {#sec:comparisonplot}

This figure is designed to compare **a single dimension** across experimentsâ€”i.e., it is not suitable for multi-dimensional data. Specifically, this figure is intended to illustrate comparisons of "Region" across experiments. Therefore, it is recommended to use variables that contain `"REG"` as the only dimension (without additional dimensions), such as `qgdp`, `ppriv`, `EV`, `tot`, and `u` from the GTAPv7 model.  

**Note:** The command will automatically generate a separate figure for each selected variable. For example, if you choose to plot `qgdp`, `ppriv`, `EV`, `tot`, and `u`, the output will include six separate figures by default.

This figure can be used for other single-dimensional comparisons beyond "Region," as long as the only dimension being illustrated is one-dimensional (e.g., `REG`, `COMM`, `ACTS`, etc.).

**Tip:** To check which data is suitable for this figure, use the command: `"HARplus::group_data_by_dims"`. Variables listed within the sublist `"1D"` are compatible with this figure.

To better understand how the command works, I highly encourage you to use the help command: `"?comparison_plot"` to explore all available options.  

**Tip:** Since the plot does not allow direct font size adjustments, the key to achieving the best figure format is to modify **panel_rows**/**panel_cols** and **width**/**height** for optimal output. By default, the command automatically calculates a balanced square layout, but I highly recommend experimenting with these settings to refine the result.  

```{r Comparison Plot, eval = FALSE}
comparison_plot(sl4.plot.data$REG,
                x_axis_from = "Region",
                plot_var = sl4plot,
                title_prefix = "Impact on",
                output_dir = output.folder,
                description_as_title = TRUE,
                compare_by_experiment = FALSE,
                invert_panel = FALSE,
                separate_figure = FALSE,
                color_tone = "grey",
                panel_rows = NULL,
                panel_cols = NULL,
                width = 20,
                height = 12,
                legend_position = "bottom")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/cpsplot.png")
```

# Comparison Report Table  

This is a report table for all variables used in the comparison plot. Based on the previous plot structure, the table pivots the data in the order of **Experiment > Region**, with all variables presented in a wide format (i.e., each variable has its own column). The table also avoids repeating experiment names and maintains the same sorting order as the figure.

```{r Comparison Table, eval = FALSE}
report_table(sl4.plot.data$REG, vars = sl4plot$Variable, 
             col_names = sl4plot$Description,  
             x_axis_from = "Region",
             output_dir = output.folder)
```


# GTAP Macro Variable Plot {#sec:macroplot}  

This figure is designed to display aggregated values for comparison across all experiments, such as global economic impacts. It is specifically intended for GTAP Macro variables extracted from the `"Macros"` header in `<.sl4>` files. 

**Tip:** This figure can also be used for other types of aggregated data.  

To generate this figure, users must first extract the relevant GTAP Macro variables using the `<gtap_macros_data>` command:  

```{r GTAP Macro Plot Data, eval = FALSE}
Macros <- do.call(gtap_macros_data, c(as.list(paste0(input.folder, "/", case.name, ".sl4")),
                  list(experiment_names = case.name)))
```

While it's quite similar process to other variables, the process is a little trickier for GTAP Macros variable since those variables are nested in a single header `"Macros"` and did not follow your mapping external file automatically.

If you want to specifically only some variables within the GTAP Macros to be plotted as well as to rename those variable, you can do as the follows in R environment:

```{r GTAP Macro Plot Data Rename, eval = FALSE}
# Selecting Variables
selected_marcro <- c("pgdpwld", "qgdpwld", "vgdpwld")
macros_new_name <- c("pgdpwld", "qgdpwld", "vgdpwld")

# Rename
macro.map <- data.frame(
  Variable = selected_marcro,
  Description = macros_new_name,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```
**Tip:** This mapping process can also be skipped and used the same .xlsx file to construct like other variables. However, you must define each variable in the `"Macros"` header manually in the "Variable" column. 

To plot this figure, you can use the following command

```{r GTAP Macro Plot, eval = FALSE}
macro_plot(Macros,
           plot_var = macro.map,
           compare_by_experiment = FALSE,
           color_tone = "grey",
           output_dir = output.folder,
           description_as_title = FALSE,
           panel_rows = 2,
           width = 45,
           separate_figure = FALSE,
           legend_position = "bottom")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/GTAPMacros.png")
```

```{r GTAP Macro Table, eval = FALSE}
scalar_table(Macros, vars = selected_marcro, 
             output_dir = output.folder)
```


# Detail Plot {#sec:detailplot}  

This plot is designed for large-scale data visualization, as implied by its name, `<detail_plot>`. It illustrates all sectors (`COMM` or `ACTS`) or all regions (`REG`) for each experiment.  

This differs from `<comparison_plot>`, which only visualizes **selected regions**. Some GTAPv7 variables suitable for this figure include `qo`, `qxw`, `qmw`, `pmw`, `pxw`, and `qgdp`, plotted across **all regions** within the same experiment.  

Since the variable you want to plot may come from different dataframes (i.e., different dimension names), I have developed a function to simplify this process. By selecting `"split_by"` as the primary column shared across all variables to be plotted, you can specify `"y_axis_from"` with multiple columns. The function will automatically identify the corresponding column in each dataset.  

Another powerful tool is the `top_impact` option that allows for **automatic filtering** by selecting only the **most affected variables**. For example, setting `top_impact = 10` will include the **top 5 positive** and **top 5 negative** values. If fewer than 5 exist in either category, additional values will be included to meet the specified limit.  

For example, in the following code snippet, the function will locate all variables within the dimensions `COMM*REG`, `REG*COMM`, `ACTS*REG`, and `REG*ACTS` for plotting:  

```{r Detail Plot, eval = FALSE}
lapply(sl4.plot.data, function(df) {
  detail_plot(df,
              y_axis_from = c("Commodity", "Activity"),
              split_by = "Region",
              plot_var = sl4plot,
              output_dir = output.folder,
              description_as_title = TRUE,
              top_impact = 10,
              panel_rows = 1,
              panel_cols = NULL,
              separate_figure = FALSE,
              invert_panel = TRUE,
              width = 50)})
```

```{r detail plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/detail_plot.png")
```

```{r detail plot top impact, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/detail_plot_top10.png")
```

**Tip:** This figure can include multiple variables on the y-axis, but you may need to manually define the `"width"` and `"height"` of the output accordingly.


# Decomposition (Stack) Plot {#sec:stackplot}

This plot is designed for **visualizing decomposition results**, allowing users to analyze the contribution of different components to a total value. Unlike `<detail_plot>`, which visualizes all regions or sectors, `<stack_plot>` represents **the breakdown of a variable across selected categories**.  

Additionally, this plot provides an option to **further decompose the results** by **unstacking** the components instead of displaying them as a stacked bar. This flexibility makes it suitable for analyzing **welfare decomposition, trade decomposition, or other GTAP structural breakdowns**.  

Some GTAPv7 variables that are well-suited for this plot include **welfare decomposition components (`A`), terms of trade decomposition (`E1`), and other breakdown analyses**.  

Since decomposition data often involves multiple components, **renaming and restructuring the data** may be necessary before plotting. For example, the following command renames the `"COLUMN"` values in the `har.plot.data` dataframe to provide more meaningful labels for visualization:  

```{r Decomposition Plot, eval = FALSE}
# Rename Value if needed
wefare.decomp.rename <- data.frame(
  ColumnName = "COLUMN",
  OldName = c("alloc_A1", "ENDWB1", "tech_C1", "pop_D1", "pref_G1", "tot_E1", "IS_F1"),
  NewName = c("Alloc Eff.", "Endwb", "Tech Chg.", "Pop", "Perf", "ToT", "I-S"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

har.plot.data <- rename_value(har.plot.data, mapping.file = wefare.decomp.rename)
har.plot.data[["A"]][["Variable"]] <- "Welfare"

# Define Decomposition
stack_plot(data = har.plot.data[["A"]],
          x_axis_from = "Region",
          stack_value_from = "COLUMN",
          title_prefix = "",
          output_dir = output.folder,
          separate_figure = FALSE,
          color_tone = "green",
          width = 30,
          height = 15,
          legend_position = "bottom",
          show_total = TRUE,
          unstack_plot = FALSE,
          description_as_title = TRUE)

har.plot.data[["E1"]][["Variable"]] <- "Terms of Trade"

# Define Decomposition
stack_plot(data = har.plot.data[["E1"]],
          x_axis_from = "Region",
          stack_value_from = "PRICES",
          title_prefix = "",
          output_dir = output.folder,
          separate_figure = FALSE,
          color_tone = "green",
          width = 30,
          height = 15,
          legend_position = "bottom",
          show_total = TRUE,
          unstack_plot = TRUE,
          description_as_title = TRUE)
```

```{r stack plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/stack_plot.png")
```

```{r unstack plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bodysbobb/GTAPViz/main/vignettes/images/unstack_plot.png")
```

# Decomposition Table {#sec:stackplot}
```{r Decomposition Table, eval = FALSE}
# Table of Decomposition
decomp_table(har.plot.data, 
             header = c("A", "E1"),
             wide_cols = list(A = "COLUMN", E1 = "PRICES"),
             total_column = TRUE,
             output_dir = output.folder,
             export_table = TRUE)
```


# Useful Commands {#sec:usefulcmd}  

If you need to automatically modify any value in any column across the entire dataframe before plottingâ€”such as renaming countries in the `REG` column (e.g., changing `USA` to `United States` or `CHN` to `China`)â€”the following command will be useful:  

```{r Rename Value, eval = FALSE}
rename.region <- data.frame(
  ColumnName = "REG",
  OldName = c("USA", "CHN"),
  NewName = c("United States", "China"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

har.plot.data.rename <- rename_value(har.plot.data, mapping.file = rename.region)
```

**Tip:** You can also create this dataframe for mapping in Excel and import it into the R environment.  
**Note:** The column names must be `"OldName"` and `"NewName"`. The `"ColumnName"` can be specified directly in the `<rename_value>` command, as shown in the example: `rename_value(data, "REG", mapping.file = "/your/file.xlsx")`
